- Typescript project where I tried realtime session based group chat application using socket.io
- Implement backend in nodejs typescript in class based programming
- To compile the ts files write ```npx tsc``` to compile the code and then run ```node dist/index.js```
- Frontend is made in react and MUI components using tsx.
- Write ```npm run dev``` to start the frontend.
